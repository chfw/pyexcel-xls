**pyexcel-{{file_type}}** is a tiny wrapper library to read, manipulate and
write data in {{file_type}} format and it can read xlsx and xlsm fromat.
You are likely to use it with `pyexcel <https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel>`_.

New flag: `detect_merged_cells` allows you to spread the same value among
all merged cells. But be aware that this may slow down its reading
performance.

New flag: `skip_hidden_row_and_column` allows you to skip hidden rows
and columns and is defaulted to **True**. It may slow down its reading
performance. And it is only valid for 'xls' files. For 'xlsx' files,
please use pyexcel-xlsx.

Warning
================================================================================

xls file cannot contain more than 65,000 rows. You are risking the reputation
of yourself/your company/
`your country <https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54423988>`_ if you keep
using xls and are not aware of its row limit.
